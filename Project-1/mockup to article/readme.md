Project Instructions

Review the Article to Mockup Project Rubric.
https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/145/view

Download and unzip mockup-to-article.zip in the Supporting Materials section, below. You'll find index.html, the article mockup image
(blog-mockup.pdf) and a file called reflections.txt inside.
Use what you've learned about web development so far to edit index.html so that it looks exactly like the mockup image. You will need to use
new elements, which means that you'll need to research and experiment! (Hint: look up "superscript," "horizontal rule," and "strikethrough.").

Note: You can recreate the mockup without using a single <br> tag! You don't need to worry about line breaks. The text should naturally wrap
depending on how wide the window is.

When you've finished building the article, open up reflections.txt. You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development in reflections.txt. Answer the following questions:
What new skills have you learned?
What has been easy?
What has been difficult?
How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
